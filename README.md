  * Create 7 sub section for each of the days of next week
  * Get the correct dates for each of these days and display that on the HTML file using JS 
* Create CSS file to format things (not really the prio for this project)
* Connect to weather API
  * Grab temperature in Celsius (obviously) and display that for each of the sections
